- **SQLite**: In-memory or file-based database for lightweight and simple setup.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.x or higher
- Composer
- Laravel 10.x or higher
- SQLite or any other supported database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- cURL (for testing API endpoints)

## Installation

Follow the steps below to get the project running:

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-management-api.git
cd user-management-api
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

Run the following command to install Laravel dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

### Step 3: Set up the `.env` file

Copy the example environment file and update the necessary variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Make sure to configure the database settings in `.env` to use **SQLite**:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=/absolute/path/to/database/database.sqlite
```

Create the SQLite database file:

```bash
touch database/database.sqlite
```

### Step 4: Generate the application key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### Step 5: Run migrations

To create the necessary tables in the database, run:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Step 6: Serve the application

You can run the application locally using Laravelâ€™s development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

The application will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
